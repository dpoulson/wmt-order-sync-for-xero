Automatically creates and registers paid invoices in Xero upon WooCommerce order completion.

== Description ==

The **Order Sync for Xero** seamlessly integrates your e-commerce platform with your Xero accounting software, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring your financials are always up-to-date.

This plugin automatically handles the creation of invoices in Xero as soon as a customer completes a payment and their WooCommerce order is marked as *completed*. It handles various payment methods, and accurately maps customer and product data to your Xero contacts and items.

**Key Features:**

* **Automated Invoice Creation:** Generates a corresponding invoice in Xero instantly when a WooCommerce order is paid and completed.
* **Accurate Data Mapping:** Correctly maps customer details, product line items, discounts, and shipping charges.
* **Tax Compliance:** Ensures all applicable sales tax/VAT rules are correctly transferred to the Xero invoice.
* **Payment Handling:** Registers the payment against the invoice in Xero, marking it as paid (based on your configuration).
* **Error Logging:** Includes robust logging to help diagnose and resolve any synchronization issues.

### 2. Configuration

1.  Navigate to the **WooCommerce > Xero Invoicing** settings page.
